# SSE Status Alignment Summary

## ✅ Updated SSE Implementation

The SSE notification service has been updated to align with your application's actual status enums from Prisma schema:

### Request Status Messages

**RequestStatus Enum Values:**
- `New` → "Your request has been received"
- `Acknowledged` → "Your request has been acknowledged by your waiter"
- `InProgress` → "Your request is being handled by your waiter"
- `Completed` → "Your request has been completed"
- `OnHold` → "Your request is temporarily on hold"
- `Cancelled` → "Your request has been cancelled"
- `Done` → "Your request is complete"

### Order Status Messages

**OrderStatus Enum Values:**
- `New` → "Your order has been received"
- `Acknowledged` → "Your order has been acknowledged and is being prepared"
- `InProgress` → "Your order is being prepared in the kitchen"
- `Complete` → "Your order has been completed"
- `Delivered` → "Your order has been delivered to your table"
- `Paid` → "Your order has been paid and is complete"
- `Cancelled` → "Your order has been cancelled"
- `Rejected` → "Unfortunately, your order could not be fulfilled"

## Changes Made

### 1. Type Safety Improvements
- ✅ Added proper `RequestStatus` and `OrderStatus` enum imports from `@prisma/client`
- ✅ Updated method signatures to use enum types instead of generic strings
- ✅ Updated private message generation methods to use enum-based Record types

### 2. Message Alignment
- ✅ Replaced generic "made up" status messages with app-specific ones
- ✅ Updated README documentation with correct status values and examples
- ✅ Ensured all status messages are user-friendly and informative

### 3. Example SSE Events

**Request Update:**
```json
{
  "type": "request_update",
  "data": {
    "status": "Completed",
    "previousStatus": "InProgress",
    "message": "Your request has been completed (Assistance) - Table 5"
  }
}
```

**Order Update:**
```json
{
  "type": "order_update", 
  "data": {
    "status": "Complete",
    "previousStatus": "InProgress",
    "message": "Your order has been completed (3 items) - Table 5"
  }
}
```

## Integration

The WaiterService methods automatically use the correct enum types:
- `updateRequestStatus(id, RequestStatus.Completed)` → Triggers SSE with proper status
- `updateOrderStatus(id, OrderStatus.Complete)` → Triggers SSE with proper status

## Testing

You can test the SSE implementation by:
1. Starting the API server
2. Connecting to SSE endpoint: `GET /sse/session/{sessionId}` with JWT
3. Triggering status updates via waiter endpoints
4. Observing real-time notifications with correct status messages

All status messages now properly reflect your application's actual workflow and enum values.
