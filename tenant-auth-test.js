// Simple JWT token generator for testing tenant authentication
// This would normally be generated by the auth service but we'll create one manually for testing

// Payload from successful tenant login
const payload = {
  sub: "0b578a2d-5a47-43f1-a036-e876745f14f2",
  type: "tenant", 
  email: "info@redbut.co.za",
  name: "RedBut Holdings"
};

// Note: In production this would be the actual token from the login process
// For testing purposes, use this structure to create a token with jwt.sign()

console.log('Expected JWT Payload for tenant authentication:');
console.log(JSON.stringify(payload, null, 2));

console.log('\nWhen this token is validated by the JWT strategy:');
console.log('1. JWT signature is verified against secret');
console.log('2. Token type "tenant" is detected');
console.log('3. No database validation is performed');
console.log('4. User object is created directly from JWT payload');
console.log('5. Authentication succeeds without querying waiters table');

console.log('\nThe fix ensures tenant tokens bypass database validation completely.');
